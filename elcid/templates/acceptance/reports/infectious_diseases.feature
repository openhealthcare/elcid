As a User
I need an overview of the infectious diseases liasion.

Given I am on the reports section
When I click on Id Liason Report
Then there should be a list of reports for each month.

Given that I click on one of these reports.
When I click on a report, that report should download.
When I open up that report I should see the columns, Name, Age, Gender, A count of clinical advice given among others.
