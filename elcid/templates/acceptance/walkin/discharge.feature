As a Nurse
I need to be able to judge that a patient can be dealt with by the community nurses, and
discharge them with a letter.

Given that I am on the Walkin Nurse Triage list
Given that there is a patient on the list
Given I click next
Given I don't add HIV Point of Care or Observations
Given I click nurse led care.
Then I fill in details and click remove from list.
Then the patient should be removed from the list and a clinic letter brought up.
