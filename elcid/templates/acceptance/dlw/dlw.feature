As a Doctor
I need to see all of the patients Discharged in the last week
So that I can review recent discharges and ensure that we have delivered
appropriate care, and that our record of that care is accurate.

Given that a patient on the service has been Discharged in the last week
When I go to the Discharged Last Week Ward Round
Then I should see that patient in the list of patients
