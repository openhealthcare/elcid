As a Micro Haem Administrator
I need to be able to add a patient and diagnosis for a patient

Given that I am on the patient list screen and have the micro_haem role
I should have a link to add a refer a haem patient

Given I have clicked Haem Referral, I should be able to fill in demographics.
Given I enter into the hospital number box a patient number that does not exist
I should get the option to add in the patient details.

Given I have entered a hospital number and some demographics information. I should
be able to click through to add diangosis.

Given that I have added some diagnosis. I should be able to click save and be
redirected to the haem view, and see the diagnosis that I added.
