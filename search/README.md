How to search an how to extract

Searchin uses Search Rules

A search rule is a discoverable feature.

By default all subrecords are wrapped in search rules.

To override a subrecord's search rule, create a search rule with the slug of a subrecords api name.

By default a search rule will allow you to search on all fields.

If you declare additional fields. These will be added.

If you declare a list of field names, then only
these will be searchable.

TO DO
rename column to row in the query
remove the and or combination in its current state
extract the subrecord discoverable into a subrecord wrapper
extract the fields into fields wrappers
order nested extracts, patient, episode then subrecords
